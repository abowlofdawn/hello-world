#Note
##Basic information
###*Nature of science*
1. is a process(every changing, testing)
2. not domatic
3. does not bow to public opinion, nor to democray or "fairness", cannot explain everthing and shouldn't try( NOMA )

###*Palaeoanthropology*
1. physics&chemistry( dating )
2. biology&evolutionary theroy
3. zoology -- stydy of animals
4. botony -- study of plants
5. geology

###*Time span of vertebrate evolution*
1. paleozoic Era -- 500 mya marks the capacity to form bone, and hence there is a more complete fossil record
2. Mesozoic Era -- reptiles were dominant land vertebrates and expanded into a variety of ecological niches
3. Cenozoic Era --   

+ Tertiary periods 
 - Paleocene
 - Eocene
 - Oligocene
 - Miocene
 - Oliocene

+ Quaternary periods
 - Pleistocene 
 - Holocene

 ###*Taphonomy*
 化学形成学  
 study of the process of decau and perservation of organic materical
 ###*Mineralization*
 矿化  
 is the process in which part of animals or some plants become transformed into stone-like structures. Usually occurs very slowly and cell are replaced
 ###*Fossils*
 are traces or remnants of organisms found in geological bed on the earth's surface
###*Earliest fossil evidence*
insects form the order Lepidoptera, researchers in Germany, Triassic -- Jurassic boundary, shared morphdogical characteristics with living moths in the suborder Glossata, including a tubular feeding device( Proboscis )
